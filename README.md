# Neural-Network
My first attempt at coding a neural network!
My first attempt at coding a neural network! Uses a neural network to figure out whether or not an input vector is above a similarity threshold to one pre-determined vector. not the most accurate, but it does some interesting things :)

Some AI was used in getting the code to run on GitHub Pages, but all functionality and most of the website was still coded by me.
